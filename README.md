# Cluster-in-the-cloud/HPC

## Background

[Cluster-in-the-cloud](https://github.com/acrc/cluster-in-the-cloud) allows users to submit jobs to a slurm scheduler which then spins up requested instances in a heterogeneous HPC environment.  

Launch a small VM instance
Launch permanenet shared, scalable (parallel) storage 
Install cluster-in-the-cloud, with profile downloaded from organisation template.
Given sufficient budget each job should set up an instance with budget controls and authentication, through AD.  Spin up research instances as in research-compute-instance, or otherwise.
Lainch shared

Auto spin down dormant instances.
Persist storage but connect to Blob so users can move data onto/off instance.

# Sprint objectives 
* Create Blueprints and learning path to ensure security of a cluster-in-the-cloud: data, access and cost
